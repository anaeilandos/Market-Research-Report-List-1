<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PRRS Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Live Vaccines</li><li>Killed Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PRRS (Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome) vaccines market consists of two main types: live vaccines and killed vaccines. Live vaccines use attenuated virus strains to stimulate a strong immune response, providing lasting immunity but carrying a slight risk of reversion to virulence. Killed vaccines contain inactivated virus particles, offering a safer alternative with minimized risks, albeit potentially requiring booster doses for optimal protection. Both types serve to enhance herd immunity and manage the economic impact of PRRS in swine production.</p></p>
